Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application

Overview

A web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
This project includes a Player vs Player mode and a Player vs AI mode. 
The goal is to get three of the same marks (either 'X' or 'O') in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Features

1. Player vs Player Mode: Two players can play on the same device, alternating turns.
2. Player vs AI Mode: One player can play against the computer (AI), with the AI making random moves.
3. Game Reset: After a winner is declared or the game ends in a draw, players can start a new game.
4. Responsive Design: The game board adjusts based on screen size for a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
   Technologies Used

HTML: To create the structure of the game (game board, buttons, etc.)
CSS: To style the game and make it visually appealing.
JavaScript: To add functionality to the game (handling user input, checking for winners, managing game state, and enabling AI mode).

The human player will always play 'O' and take the first turn.

Game Rules

Players alternate placing their marks (either 'X' or 'O') on the grid.
The first player to get three marks in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins the game.
If all grid spaces are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
